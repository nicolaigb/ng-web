  <SText>Up to Us is a NYC-based non-profit focused on activating young people to engage in civic action like registering to vote and receiving the Covid vaccine. In partnership with HeadCount, we designed a customizable voter registration flow that could be easily co-branded by major clients such as Billie Eilish, Phish, and Toney&apos;s Chocolonely. The product is geared towards Gen-Z voters and provides a simple way for checking voter registration status and updating it accordingly. You can find Kim Petras&apos; branded flow here.</SText>
