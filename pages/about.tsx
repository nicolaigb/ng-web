      Some kind of filler text about me and what I do. Who I look up to, role models. What I wanna do. What is my dream. What have I done. What is the ideology behind my own work. I am passionate about the intersection between technology and creative expression, exploring ways they inform and influence each other. Understanding these two ideals gives way to creating medium-spanning and groundbreaking experiences that can scale to thousands of visitors. ok just a couple more lines that would fill to the end of the box and thatâ€™s it
